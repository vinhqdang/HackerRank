## Running:

- You need to install R (>= 3.3.1) 64-bit version
- Put the R file in same directory with two CSV (train & test) files
- Loading R, set the working directory (by using the command `setwd`) to the directory of the source code and two CSV files
- Load R file (`source()` command)
- Run corresponding function:
  -- `process_email_dnn` for using deep neural networks
  -- `process_email_rf` for using RandomForest
  -- `process_email_glm` for logistic regression
- By default these functions will write output to `prediction.csv` file. However, you can change it by passing the file name to `output_file` parameter in all three functions.
